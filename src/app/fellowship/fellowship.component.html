            Becoming an expert in any career takes time, practice and oversight. Aesthetics Canada© recognizes this.
            The botox and filler
            courses provides the most comprehensive training available in Canada. At the botox course, learners have
            the opportunity to
            inject many cosmetic treatment areas and perform therapeutic treatments as well. The hands-on experience
            provided at these
            courses is extensive and thousands of units of neuromodulators are utilized to achieve this. Hence our
            learners can leave and
            produce natural results and ensure patient safety. But our educators queried how to take this learning
            experience to the
            next level, and created the Canadian Fellowship of Cosmetic Injectables.

          <p class="fs-5 fw-light lh-base mt-5" style="text-align: justify">
            Our Fellowship Program is designed to give medical professionals guaranteed longitudinal clinical
            experience.
            It guarantees clinical experience under the direct supervision of industry leaders including surgeons,
            specialists, GPs,
            and nurse experts. This program allows learners the chance to see how clinics operate behind the scenes.
            It ensures
            learners develop good before and after photos as part of a complete treatment portfolio. It provides job
            and networking
            opportunities while building confidence, safe technique and skill. This program is revolutionizing the
            industry and
            delivers the highest level of learning available in medical aesthetics. Applications will be accepted and
            interviews
            with the applicable campus will be scheduled.

            After taking the botox and filler course I knew I wanted to continue learning through this program and the
            amazing
            educators. This Fellowship program did not disappoint. Not only does this program give you the opportunity
            to advance
            your injection skills but teaches you everything else that goes along with a successful medical cosmetic
            clinic.
            Whether you are new to injectables or an experienced injector you will undoubtably learn from this program
            as it
            is tailored to your specific needs. I was given the opportunity to work with Becky at External Affairs it
            was a
            privilege to learn from such a talented injector and business woman. Her passion for the industry is
            evident in
            her teaching.
